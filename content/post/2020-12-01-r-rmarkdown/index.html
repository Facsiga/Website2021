<h1>R Markdown lives on</h1>
<p>Do not go gentle into that good night,<br />
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br />
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
<p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br />
Because their words had forked no lightning they<br />
Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
<p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br />
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br />
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
<p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br />
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br />
Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
<p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br />
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br />
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
<p>And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br />
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br />
Do not go gentle into that good night.<br />
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
